This is the code repository for [Learn Ansible](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/learn-ansible-fundamentals-ansible-2x?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788998758), published by Packt.

**Automate cloud, security, and network infrastructure using Ansible 2.x**

## What is this book about?
Ansible has grown from a small open source orchestration tool to a full-blown orchestration and configuration management tool owned by Red Hat. Its powerful core modules cover a wide range of infrastructure, both on-premise and public clouds, operating systems, devices, and servicesâ€”meaning it can be used to manage pretty much your entire end-to-end environment. Trends and surveys say that Ansible is the choice of tool among system administrators as it is so easy to use.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Write your own playbooks to configure servers running CentOS, Ubuntu, and Windows Server
* See how to identify repeatable tasks and write playbooks to automate them
* Define a highly available public cloud infrastructure in code, making it easy to distribute your infrastructure configuration alongside your own code
* Find out how to deploy and configure Ansible Tower and Ansible AWX
* Use community contributed roles and contribute your own roles
